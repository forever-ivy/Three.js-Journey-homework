## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Running a Project

1. Navigate to any lesson directory:

```bash
cd 05-animations
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open the provided localhost URL in your browser.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## 📖 Learning Path

1. **Sequential Learning** - Follow the numbered order for best results.
2. **Hands-on Practice** - Run and modify each project.
3. **Core Concepts** - Focus on Scene, Camera, and Renderer fundamentals.
4. **Transition to R3F** - Understand how R3F simplifies Three.js concepts into a declarative, component-based approach.
5. **Experimentation** - Try different parameters and add new features.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you will master:

- Three.js fundamentals and API usage
- 3D scene creation and management
- Geometry, materials, and texture application
- Animation and interaction implementation
- Lighting and shadow systems
- Building complex 3D applications with React Three Fiber
- Performance optimization techniques
